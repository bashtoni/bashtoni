### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam Bashton.

I'm a Cloud Computing guy. I got to do it all on 'easy mode': when I started,
there was only S3 and SQS, and I only had to incrementally learn all the rest when
they were released.
I'm a big fan of 'serverless' technologies.

I run Fedora Linux on my desktop and my editor of choice is NeoVim.

My [github gists](https://gist.github.com/bashtoni) have a load of random AWS
CLI / bash one liners that you might find useful.

PS: No, I didn't write bash.
